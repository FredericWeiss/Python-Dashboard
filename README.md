This is a small project that I implemented to display my local clubs finances in a dashboard.
The dashboard is very simple but displays all important metrics I need to steer the clubs finances.
To build the dashboard the Streamlit framework was used in combination with Python.
Skills I used in the project was applying the Streamlit framework, data modification and plotting.
